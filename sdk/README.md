# suilend-public/sdk

A TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Suilend program published on npm as [`@suilend/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suilend/sdk).

For examples, please see [suilend-public/frontend](https://github.com/solendprotocol/suilend-public/tree/HEAD/frontend), an open-source Suilend client powered by and developed alongside the Suilend SDK, in the Suilend monorepo.

Note: `suilend-public/frontend` imports the SDK via aliased paths (see [suilend-public/frontend/tsconfig.ts](https://github.com/solendprotocol/suilend-public/tree/HEAD/frontend/tsconfig.json)) and does not use the npm package.
